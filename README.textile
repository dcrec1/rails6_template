Read the "Gemfile":blob/master/Gemfile to understand everything this template installs and pre-configures for you.

One of gems, "Johnson":http://rubygems.org/gems/johnson, still has some issues compiling under Ruby 1.9.2 so you will need to use Ruby 1.8.7 instead.

This template is heavily dependent on wget so, if you're using a Mac, you will need to install it first. The recommended way is to install "Homebrew":https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew first and then:

<pre><code>brew install wget</code></pre>

Since Github started forcing SSL in all its URLs, we need to download the template file separately:

<pre><code>wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/dcrec1/rails3_template/raw/master/main.rb -O /tmp/rails3_template.rb</pre></code>

Then whenever you want to create a new project, just do:

<pre><code>rails new app_name -T -m /tmp/rails3_template.rb</code></pre>

Change <tt>app_name</tt> for your project name. You can configure what you need and run <tt>rake db:migrate</tt> to get started.
